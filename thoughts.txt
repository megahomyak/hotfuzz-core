hello world

----------

Insertion:

he[l]lo world
hello wor[l]d

- same hot, same fuzz => fuzz collision

he[l]lo neighbor
hello wor[l]d

- same hot, different fuzz => fuzz collision

he[l]lo world
[h]ello world

- same fuzz, different hot => hot collision

he[l]lo neighbor
[h]ello world

- different fuzz, different hot => correct insertion

Removal:

he[l]lo world
hello wor[l]d

- same hot, same fuzz => fuzz collision

he[l]lo neighbor
hello wor[l]d

- same hot, different fuzz => fuzz collision

he[l]lo world
[h]ello world

- same fuzz, different hot => hot collision

he[l]lo neighbor
[h]ello world

- different fuzz, different hot => correct insertion

================================================================

Insertion (and general explanations):
So, like, we have Fuzz. Fuzz is a HashMap, but there's also a way to query the hashmap by going through its every item, and there's also an insertion error when there's a collision (disregarding Char variation).

So Fuzz is merely a way to query that HashMap.

And so there's Hot, which is also a way to query the HashMap and also a restriction. Now, it looks through every element and finds those for which their Hot chars match the input string, maybe there'll be an exact match, maybe only prefixed matches, it's not certain, but there's also a restriction: it should be impossible to insert a new entry if it has its sequence of Hot characters to be a subsequence or a supersequence of any other map entry (so, like, "!s1.startswith(s2) && !s2.startswith(s1)")

Removal: you can't remove a string if it's not there. For example, if a "he[l]lo" is in the map, it can't be removed by a "[l]emon", it has to be exactly "he[l]lo"

Getting: since it's HotFuzz, there are three ways of getting an entry:
* Using a key, like with a hashmap
* Using Fuzz
* Using Hot
, which are not modifying the internal structure in any way (not adding anything, not removing anything, not rearranging anything), so I shouldn't worry about that

Iteration:
Just go over the entries of the HashMap, nothing too complicated

--------------

Decided not to do plain `get` and `get_mut` since it will require me to have a separate data struuuuuunevermind I will have it anyway for iteration. Or not? No, I can say that iteration is just like if we queried Fuzz with an empty string, it will match literally everything then... Or will it? *Vsauce music starts playing* If I say that a "Fuzz" match is a match containing all the Fuzz characters in the same order (although they can have gaps in them), will an empty prompt match since it has no Fuzz characters? I probably should just limit people from doing it altogether on type level. Although... Maybe, if we're talking UIs, it will be better to show all the elements, so I should probably just do *that*

Upd: no, fuck that, it'll be too surprising for users. I'm making a type-level limitation with an `.iter()` method
